## Hello!

I'm Armored Dragon, and I like to help people!
Here you will find a lot of my programming projects! My goal as a programmer is to help as many people as possible.
This is the home of my automated tools, security applications, and what ever else I find that needs to be made.

I unfortunetly do not have many social media platforms. The social media accounts that I do control do not get used in any meaningful amount.<br>
If you would like to know more about me, visit my website!
